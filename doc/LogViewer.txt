DESCRIPTION					       *logviewer-description*

Many applications produce multiple log files; there may be one per component
or one production log and a separate debug log, or one from the server daemon
and one from the client application. During analysis, one needs to step
through them in tandem. Doing this manually in split windows is tedious;
'scrollbind' usually doesn't help because different amounts of log lines are
written to each file.

As long as each log file provides a timestamp or similar monotonically
increasing field, this plugin automatically syncs the cursor movement in one
log window to all other windows. When moving to another line in the current
window, all log lines that fall in the time range covered by the movement are
highlighted automatically.

==============================================================================
USAGE							     *logviewer-usage*
							    *:LogViewerMaster*
:LogViewerMaster	Designate the current buffer as the log master. Only
			cursor movements in this buffer will sync to other
			buffers; movements in other buffers won't affect the
			markers any more.

							    *:LogViewerUpdate*
:LogViewerUpdate CursorMoved | CursorHold | Manual
			Set the trigger for the syncing to the passed event.
			By default, each cursor movement will immediately
			update all other log buffers. With CursorHold, this
			will only happen after 'updatetime'. With Manual, it
			has to be explicitly triggered with
			|:LogViewerTarget|.

							    *:LogViewerTarget*
:LogViewerTarget	Set the target log line (the basis for the
			highlighting in all other log buffers) to the current
			line in the current buffer.
:[count]LogViewerTarget	Set the target log line to [count] timestamps down
			from the current target timestamp.
:LogViewerTarget {timestamp}
			Set the target log line to the first timestamp that
			matches {timestamp}. Useful to proceed to the
			beginning of a date when interesting things have
			happened.

INSTALLATION					      *logviewer-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim logviewer.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					      *logviewer-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					     *logviewer-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

						      *g:logviewer_syncUpdate*
To change the default update trigger (that can be switched via
|:LogViewerUpdate| to Manual : >
    let g:logviewer_syncUpdate = 'Manual'
<
							 *g:logviewer_syncAll*
By default, there is no master log file; movements in any log buffer cause
syncing in the other buffers. To turn that off: >
    let g:logviewer_syncAll = 0
You will need to use |:LogViewerMaster| on one log buffer to start the
syncing.
						       *g:logviewer_filetypes*
Only buffers with certain filetypes are considered log files. The setting is a
comma-separated list of filetypes (|autocmd-patterns|): >
    let g:logviewer_filetypes = 'log4j,syslog'
<
							  *b:logTimestampExpr*
By default, the timestamp is expected as a whitespace-separated decimal number
starting at the first column. You should define the appropriate timestamp
format for each log filetype (in |g:logviewer_filetypes|). Typically, this is
done in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/{filetype}.vim. For example, the log4j timestamp
pattern corresponding to the "%d" format is: >
    let b:logTimestampExpr = '^\d\S\+\d \d\S\+\d\ze\s' " %d, e.g. 2011-08-17 13:08:30,509
To determine the chronological order, LogViewer uses a numerical compare for
integer timestamps, and case-sensitive string comparison for everything else.

							     *logviewer-signs*
To mark the current target logline and the corresponding log line ranges in
the other log buffers, LogViewer uses |signs|:
    logviewerTarget	The target log line at the current cursor position, or
			set via |:LogViewerTarget|
    logviewerFrom	The (earliest when moving down towards later log
			entries) log line corresponding to the move of the
			target.
    logviewerTo		The last log line corresponding to the move of the
			target.

You can redefine the sign definitions after the plugin/logviewer.vim script
has been sourced, e.g.: >
    runtime plugin/logviewer.vim
    sign define logviewerTarget   text=T linehl=CursorLine
<
The default signs use line highlighting for a |hl-CursorLine|-like visual
indication of the positions (the 'cursorline' setting is disabled
automatically for log windows); you can define you own colors for those, too: >
    highlight logviewerTarget gui=underline guibg=Red

IDEAS							     *logviewer-ideas*

- Compare and mark current lines that are identical in all logs. Keep those
  lines so that a full picture emerges when moving along.
